# Batch parameters file
# =====================
#
# This file is used to specify the default parameters used by various qunex commands for
# HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline, additional bold preprocessing commands,
# and other analytic functions. The content of this file should be prepended to the list
# that contains all the sessions that is passed to the commands. It can added manually or 
# automatically when making use of the compileLists qunex command.
#
# This template file should be edited to include the parameters relevant for
# a given study/analysis and provide the appropriate values. For detailed description of
# parameters and their valid values, please consult the qunex documentation
* (e.g. Running HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines, Additional BOLD
# preprocessing) and online help for the relevant qunex commands.
#
#
# --> For all supported batch parameter options run: 
#     qunex -o
# 
# Please note that if a parameter is specified in the batch file qunex will set it to the value specified. 
# This is also the case for parameters that are left '' empty (e.g. `_event_file         :`). 
# This case the `_event_file` parameter is actually being set to an empty string and is being read as such by qunex. 
# The situation where this would be a misspecification would be, for instance: `_nprocess           :`. 
# In this case the `_nprocess` parameter checks how many concurrent jobs to run. If it set to an empty string then 
# the qunex engine cannot set the process number. This behavior is important so that the qunex engine can interpret 
# all specified parameters based on actual values provided (empty or some value) as opposed to making an assumptions 
# that the parameter is absent when in fact it is present with an empty string.
#
# File format
# -----------
#
# Each parameter is specified in a separate line as a 
# "_<parameter_key>: <parameter_value>" pair. For example:
#
# _hcp_brainsize:  170
#
# Empty lines and lines that start with a hash (#) are ignored.
#
#
# Parameters
# ==========
#
# The following is a list of parameters organized by the commands they relate
# to. To specify parameters, uncomment the line (it should start with the
# underscore before the parameter name) and provide the desired value. In some
# cases default values are provided. Do take care to remove the descriptors 
# (... <description>) after the values for the parameters to be used.

# _hcp_resample_myelinmaps           Comma separated paths to myelin maps [MyelinMap,SmoothedMyelinMap]
# _hcp_bold_smoothFWHM               Smoothing FWHM that matches what was used in the fMRISurface pipeline [2]
# _hcp_resample_dontfixnames         A list of comma separated bolds that will not have HCP ICAFix reapplied to them. Only applicable if single-run ICAFix was used. Generally not recommended [NONE].
# _hcp_resample_myelintarget         A myelin target file is required to run this pipeline when using a different mesh resolution than the original MSMAll registration [NONE]
# _hcp_resample_inregname            A string to enable multiple fMRI resolutions (e.g._1.6mm) [NONE]
# _hcp_resample_extractnames         List of bolds and concat names provided in the same format as the hcp_icafix_bolds parameter. Defines which bolds to extract. Exists to enable extraction of a subset of the runs in a multi-run HCP ICAFix group into a new concatenated series
# _hcp_resample_extractextraregnames Extract multi-run HCP ICAFix runs for additional surface registrations, often MSMSulc
# _hcp_resample_extractvolume        Whether to also extract the specified multi-run HCP ICAFix from the volume data, requires hcp_resample_extractnames to work [FALSE]
