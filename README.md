# README File for MNAP General Neuroimaging Utilities Pipeline

Background
==========
---

MNAP General Neuroimaging Utilities (gMRI) are neuroimaging
preprocessing and analysis utilities that support multiple tasks through a
common user interface, designed to simplify multiple steps of neuroimaging
data preprocessing and analysis from sorting of dicom files to second level
statistical analysis. They often provide a wrapper for efficiently running
other tools and software either on a single computer or computer cluster
by using PBS, SLURM or LSF scheduling.

The `gmri` utilities make use of and assume that relevant information and data
is provided in a number of file formats, further described below. The utilities
assume and help maintain a specific folder structure, further described below.
A number of utilities depend on external dependencies and make use of data and
data templates provided in a separate library.

The utilities can be used as a stand-alone toolset. However, the `gmri` utilities
were developed to efficiently integrate with the MNAP suite, as well as with a 
set of native Matlab functions, methods and utilities, and a modified version 
of HCP (Human Connectome Project) preprocessing tools. They are best utilized as 
a part of MNAP (Multimodal Neuroimaging Analysis Platform).

The utilites are developed and maintained by Grega Repov≈°, [Mind and Brain
Lab], University of Ljubljana in collaboration with the [Anticevic Lab], Yale
University.

Installation
===============================
---

### See https://bitbucket.org/hidradev/mnaptools/src/master/README.md


Usage and command documentation
===============================
---

The utilities are invoked through the `mnap` command:

`mnap <command> [option=value] [option=value] ...`

The utilities can also be called specifically through the `gmri` command. 

This bypasses the `mnap` wrapper and directly calles the python engine. 

The general use form is:

`gmri <command> [option=value] [option=value] ...`


The list of commands and their specific documentation is provided through `gmri`
command itself using the folowing options:

* `gmri -h` prints general help information,
* `gmri -l` lists all the available commands,
* `gmri -o` lists all the available options,
* `gmri -<command>` prints specific help for the specified command.

Perusing documentation, please note the following conventions used:

* Square brackets `[]` denote an option or argument that is optional. The
  value listed in the brackets is the default value used, if the argument
  is not explicitly specified
* Angle brackets `<>` describe the value that should be provided
* Dashes or "flags", `-` in the documentation define input variables.
* Commands, arguments, and option names are either in small or "camel" case.
* Use descriptions are in regular "sentence" case.
* Option values are usually specified in capital case (e.g. `YES`, `NONE`).
