(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)



Actual Attempt:

A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.

Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.",checkbox,"Have you made a suicide attempt?

(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)



Actual Attempt:

A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.

Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.",checkbox,"Have you made a suicide attempt?

(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)



Actual Attempt:

A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.

Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.",checkbox,"Have you made a suicide attempt?

INSTRUCTIONS: 



This questionnaire asks you about 4 different categories of concerns that you might or might not experience. For each category there is a description of the kinds of thoughts (sometimes called obsessions) and behaviors (sometimes called compulsions) that are typical of that particular concern, followed by five questions about your experiences with these thoughts and behaviors. Please read each description carefully and answer the questions for each category based on your experiences in the last month.

""How much of your time is occupied by obsessive thoughts?""



(When obsessions occur as brief, intermittent intrusions, it may be difficult to assess time occupied by them in terms of total hours. In such cases, estimate time by determining how frequently they occur. Consider both the number of times the intrusions occur and how many hours of the day are affected. 



Ask: How frequently do the obsessive thoughts occur? Be sure to exclude ruminations and preoccupations which, unlike obsessions, are ego-syntonic and rational [but exaggerated].)","0, 0 = None. | 1, 1 = Mild, less than 1 hr/day or occasional intrusion. | 2, 2 = Moderate, 1 to 3 hrs/day or frequent intrusion. | 3, 3 = Severe, greater than 3 and up to 8 hrs/day or very frequent intrusion. | 4, 4 = Extreme, greater than 8 hrs/day or near constant intrusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""How much of an effort do you make to resist the obsessive thoughts? How often do you try to disregard or turn your attention away from these thoughts as they enter your mind?""



(Only rate effort made to resist, not success or failure in actually controlling the obsessions. How much the patient resists the obsessions may or may not correlate with their ability to control them.) 



Note that this item does not discreetly measure the severity of the intrusive thoughts; rather it rates a manifestation of health, i.e., the effort the patient makes to counteract the obsessions by means other than avoidance or the performance of compulsions. Thus, the more the patient tries to resist, the less impaired is this aspect of his/her functioning. There are ""active"" and ""passive"" forms of resistance. Patients in behavioral therapy may be encouraged to counteract their obsessive symptoms by not struggling against them [e.g., ""just let the thoughts come; passive opposition] or by intentionally bringing on the disturbing thoughts. For the purposes of this item, consider use of these behavioral techniques as forms of resistance. If the obsessions are minimal, the patient may not feel the need to resist them. In such cases, a rating of ""0"" should be given.","0, 0 = Makes an effort to always resist, or symptoms so minimal doesn't need to actively resist | 1, 1 = Tries to resist most of the time | 2, 2 = Makes some effort to resist | 3, 3 = Yields to all obsessions without attempting to control them, but does so with some reluctance | 4, 4 = Completely and willingly yields to all obsessions",,,,,,,,,,,,

(Make specific reference to the patient's target compulsions.)",radio,"6. TIME SPENT PERFORMING COMPULSIVE BEHAVIORS



""How much time do you spend performing compulsive behaviors?""



[When rituals involving activities of daily living are chiefly present, ask:] 



How much longer than most people does it take to complete routine activities because of your rituals? 



[When compulsions occur as brief, intermittent behaviors, it may be difficult to assess time spent performing them in terms of total hours. In such cases, estimate time by determining how frequently they are performed. Consider both the number of times compulsions are performed and how many hours of the day are affected. Count separate occurrences of compulsive behaviors, not number of repetitions; e.g., a patient who goes into the bathroom 20 different times a day to wash his hands 5 times very quickly, performs compulsions 20 times a day, not 5 or 5 x 20 = 100. Ask:] 



How frequently do you perform compulsions? 



(In most cases compulsions are observable behaviors (e.g. hand washing), but some compulsions are covert (e.g. silent checking).","0, 0 = None | 1, 1 = Mild (spends less than 1 hr/day performing compulsions), or occasional performance of compulsive behaviors. | 2, 2 = Moderate (spends from 1 to 3 hrs/day performing compulsions), or frequent performance of compulsive behaviors. | 3, 3 = Severe (spends more than 3 and up to 8 hrs/day performing compulsions), or very frequent performance of compulsive behaviors. | 4, 4 = Extreme (spends more than 8 hrs/day performing compulsions), or near constant performance of compulsive behaviors (too numerous to count).",,,,,,,,,,,,

[Rate degree of distress patient would experience if performance of the compulsion were suddenly interrupted without reassurance offered. In most, but not all cases, performing compulsions reduces anxiety. If, in the judgement of the interviewer, anxiety is actually reduced by preventing compulsions in the manner described above, then ask:]

""How much of an effort do you make to resist the compulsions?"" 



(Only rate effort made to resist, not success or failure in actually controlling the compulsions. How much the patient resists the compulsions may or may not correlate with their ability to control them.) 



Note that this item does not directly measure the severity of the compulsions; rather it rates a manifestation of health [i.e., the effort the patient makes to counteract the compulsions]. Thus, the more the patient tries to resist, the less impaired is this aspect of their functioning. If the compulsions are minimal, the patient may not feel the need to resist them.

[If yes, then ask:] How much do you avoid? 



(Rate degree to which patient deliberately tries to avoid things. Sometimes compulsions are designed to ""avoid"" contact with something that the patient fears. For example, clothes washing rituals would be designated as compulsions, not as avoidant behavior. If the patient stopped doing the laundry then this would constitute avoidance.)","0, 0 = No deliberate avoidance | 1, 1 = Mild, minimal avoidance | 2, 2 = Moderate, some avoidance; clearly present | 3, 3 = Severe, much avoidance; avoidance prominent | 4, 4 = Extreme, very extensive avoidance; patient does almost everything he/she can to avoid triggering symptoms",,,,,,,,,,,,
