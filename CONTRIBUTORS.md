## Report Bugs and Issues

To report an issue please navigate to [Qu|Nex Issue on BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/oriadev/qunex/issues). Here you can generate a detailed issue report. We ask, if possible, that users follow the recommended issue reporting framework: 

* Description Call — Path Access StdOut StdErr (*DC-PASS*)

- *Description* – brief description of problem
- *Call* – Exact and explicit and full call to re-create the problem with all elements of the code needed to do so.
- *Path* – Exact and absolute paths for the code used in the call and the data used in the call
- *Access* – Verify that all developers have correct access at all times with correct permissions.
- *StdOut* *StdErr* – Capture and attach complete terminal output from the call from start to finish.
