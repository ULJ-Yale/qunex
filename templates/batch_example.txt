#  Batch parameters file
#  =====================
#
#  This file is used to specify the default parameters used by various qunex commands for
#  HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline, additional bold preprocessing commands,
#  and other analytic functions. The content of this file should be prepended to the list
#  that contains all the sessions that is passed to the commands. It can added manually or 
#  automatically when making use of the compileLists qunex command.
#
#  This template file should be edited to include the parameters relevant for
#  a given study/analysis and provide the appropriate values. For detailed description of
#  parameters and their valid values, please consult the qunex documentation
*  (e.g. Running HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines, Additional BOLD
#  preprocessing) and online help for the relevant qunex commands.
#
#
#  --> For all supported batch parameter options run: 
#      qunex -o
# 
# Please note that if a parameter is specified in the batch file qunex will set it to the value specified. 
# This is also the case for parameters that are left '' empty (e.g. `_event_file         :`). 
# This case the `_event_file` parameter is actually being set to an empty string and is being read as such by qunex. 
# The situation where this would be a misspecification would be, for instance: `_nprocess           :`. 
# In this case the `_nprocess` parameter checks how many concurrent jobs to run. If it set to an empty string then 
# the qunex engine cannot set the process number. This behavior is important so that the qunex engine can interpret 
# all specified parameters based on actual values provided (empty or some value) as opposed to making an assumptions 
# that the parameter is absent when in fact it is present with an empty string.
#
#  File format
#  -----------
#
#  Each parameter is specified in a separate line as a 
#  "_<parameter_key>: <parameter_value>" pair. For example:
#
#  _hcp_brainsize:  170
#
#  Empty lines and lines that start with a hash (#) are ignored.
#
#
#  Parameters
#  ==========
#
#  The following is a list of parameters organized by the commands they relate

#  underscore before the parameter name) and provide the desired value. In some
#  cases default values are provided. Do take care to remove the descriptors 
#  (... <description>) after the values for the parameters to be used.
